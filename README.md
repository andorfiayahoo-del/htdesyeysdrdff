# Project Handover

**MUST read ALL the handover information** before doing anything else.

This repository and the local folder **must always be in sync**:
- Authoritative local folder: C:\Users\ander\My project
- Public GitHub (read-only for assistants): https://github.com/andorfiayahoo-del/htdesyeysdrdff

**Loop (event-driven, no timer):** patch → apply → push
1) Assistant proposes a patch (saved as Downloads\patch_XXXXX.patch).
2) Router attempts apply.
3) On success or attempted apply, logs are pushed immediately to this repo.
4) Assistant reads new logs and iterates.
